# python102-PCAP
This is a collection of some of my assignments when I learned some more advanced principles, representing my PCAP practice. The projects here exist as Python files, since I transitioned to PyCharm from Google Colaboratory. During this time, I was still mentored by Prof. Siva Jasthi from Metropolitan State University. I learned some new modules including calendar and time, PyPI  (Python Package Installer), string methods and processing, exceptions, closures, and Object-Oriented Programming. I was in these classes from September 2023 to May 2024.
